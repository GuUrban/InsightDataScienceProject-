# InsightDataScienceProject-
T.I.M-predicting app user conversion 
I worked on a consulting project at Insight data science, to help a design company on predicting its app user conversion. This project was completed within 20 hours, from getting data and delivering the outcomes. The key outcomes includes: 1) a model to predict the conversion;2) actionable features or user actions for their marketers and executives to maximize ROI; 3) insightful features can be implemented to improve their app user experience, ultimately increasing the app user conversion. 
Data description: 
Data was collected for the time window of December of 2018 and the first week of 2019, many of features were recorded every week, thus attached with a time stamp(for example, 12/16/2018 et al). Data includes three types: Boolean, numeric, and string which describes the encoded user ID et al. For the privacy reason, I excluded any information that could possibly reveal user id like email address after discussing with the company.
